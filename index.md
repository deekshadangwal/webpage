# About me

I am a Research Scientist at Reality Labs Research, Meta and I am interested in the design of private computer systems and applications. My interdisciplinary research spans computer architecture, privacy, computer vision, and machine learning. I received my PhD in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara where I studied computer architecture with Prof. Tim Sherwood.  

During my PhD, I have explored the privacy of program traces where the intent is to minimize information leakage to ensure safer sharing of program behavior for co-optimization. The key trade-off is balancing information leakage while maintaining utility of the privatized traces. Trace wringing was published in **ASPLOS 2019** and recognized in **IEEE Microâ€™s Top Picks** from Computer Architecture Conferences 2020. Previously, I have worked on PyRTL, a Python-based RTL specification language, and built the OpenTPU and cryptographic cores on it. I have also worked on Charm, a high-level architecture modeling language. 

During my internship at Facebook Reality Labs Research, I worked on building privacy into AR/VR pipelines. With a novel reverse engineering attack, I demonstrated that feature descriptors, previously considered safe to share, can be used to reconstruct raw user images. I present mitigations that trade off privacy (quality of reconstruction) and utility (in terms of localization accuracy). At Microsoft Research, I developed an automated framework for resource- and architecture-aware graph partitioning and fine tuning quantized neural network layers on the Brainwave NPU.
